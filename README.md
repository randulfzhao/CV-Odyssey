# CV-Odyssey

This repository is based on my notes from [CSCI-B 657 Computer Vision](https://luddy.indiana.edu/academics/courses/class/iub-spring-2025-csci-b657), a fascinating graduate-level research-focused course. It contains summaries of course content, literature reviews, and insights from recent research in computer vision. Additionally, I will add reviews of recent papers that interest me and align with current trends in CV. For the best viewing experience, please clone the whole repository and open as vault of **Obsidian**.

This repository will be continuously updated. If you notice any errors or have suggestions, please feel free to reach out!

ðŸ“– **Course notes** can be found [[Notes|here]].  
ðŸ“‘ **Literature reviews** are organized below by topic, with a reference [[LR template|template]].
